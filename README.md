## Hello there, I'm AJ Chimaera.
I am an experienced Software Engineer with over 13 years logged progressing from graduate to senior level.

Outside of work I have tinkered with game mods over the years, usually to get them working again after they stop getting supported officially.

You can also find me on Twitch, where I occasionally stream (family allowing), and Youtube, where I upload stream highlights, offline gameplay recordings, and ambient walking videos.
